This is the Impressionist Painting for CMSC434 for the Fall 2016 semester.

This application is best run on Android tablet devices.  In order to run the applicaiton, you can either start the application on an emulator or you can plug in an Android tablet and use that instead.

The following features are implemented:

1. Using the camera to take and use a picture
2. Loading an image from the device's photo gallery
3. Save the Impressionist image to the gallery
4. Change the brush stroke type
5. Change the mirror mode type

For brushes, the brush radius is dependent on how fast you move your finger across the screen.
